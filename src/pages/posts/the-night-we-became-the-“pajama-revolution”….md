In one terrible night, a protester and father of three, was publicly executed by a soldier, our President flat out told us to emigrate, and the first stone was cast against the army dispatched to open the roads.

Our evening began with an interview in which president Michel Aoun somehow managed to outdo both Donald Trump and Marie-Antoinette in a single blundering turn of the phrase.

**If we do go down in history as the Pajama Revolution, our President may sadly be remembered as “Michel Aoun-toinette”**, the man who sat in the palace in Baabda and accidentally tripped over his own brain and suggested his people emigrate.

Despite an official clarification from Baabda explaining the President’s intended meaning, the sentence escaped his lips a little too quickly and too easily for absolution. The fact that he could nonchalantly use such rhetoric vis-a-vis a nation that has bled millions of citizens in diaspora and brain drain, suggests deep-seated megalomania.

## But the true force that drove people out into streets, in their pajamas… is grief.

A father of three was executed in front of his family by an army soldier driving an army colonel. Thousands of hearts broke into millions of shards as the man’s wife and children screamed for their father. Of course, the shooter drove away behind the signature dark tinted windows we have all come to love and associate with abuse of power.

**_Last night was the night we learned that when we become true countrymen/women, the execution of a stranger can feel like the murder of the closest and dearest of relatives._** Because far beyond blood ties are the ties of our humanity, our empathy and our common fight for life.

> After last night, never again can we sit at home without a measure of self-disgust.

We cry for Alaa Abou Fakhr with no interest in his party, his agenda, his denomination, whatever he believed in that night to stand his ground. **We the people he belonged with, forbade his slaying as we forbid that any harm come to anyone, for or against change.**

**Today more than ever we must continue our stand because the matter of this murder and decades of crimes against our country are most likely in the unreliable hands of our _tainted judiciary system which to this day, is not a separate power._ **Alternatively, the verdict may be left to the martial courts of the same army institution we respected so much until it began suppressing our freedom of press whenever it was tasked with beating us off the streets. All this of course, in the name of our own good, we, the people, the “watan” they serve.

On this night, and to our great disappointment, there emerged a clear “us” vs “them”. **_It may be time for the soldiers among us to ask themselves if they serve the Nation or the State that starved it._**

On this dark day, however heavy the pain, let us open our hearts and take it all in, absorb it without suppressing it. Let it radiate out into open love for each other.

Because with this love, we will rid our land of the Evil minority that lives for power and looting.

# Our humanity, our love for each and for the value of life, are the very dragon they have awakened… and by God, it will melt the seats they hold onto at any cost.

So be careful now, tread carefully and peacefully, turn anger into determination, violence into stamina and in the words of Rudyard Kipling:

> _“Hold on when there is nothing in you, except the Will which says to them: “hold on!”’_
