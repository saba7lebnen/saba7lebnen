**Today, the individuals who pillaged our country count on the holes in our civic education. They count on us not knowing what to do next.**

“We The People” of Lebanon, at this turning point in our history, can no longer afford the luxury of not knowing how our government works.

Winning the next fight requires that every Lebanese participate in politics.

_And this applies to every last one of us, regardless of occupation, interest, education or age._

The merry band of “Kellon” will continue to use every backdoor in bureaucracy, every bit of political jargon to stall or prevent change. From nebulous threats of voids, and vacuums to endless political debates aimed at intimidating the common citizen and appearing like experts.

Meanwhile, they sit there and hope against hope, that we’re too lazy, too insecure, or too busy to learn and call their bullshit.

They hope the layman thinks “who am I to know the inner workings of the government”? **They hope none of us become true citizens, that the cab driver thinks he’s just a cab driver, the artist just an artist, the waiter just a waiter, the baker just a baker, the coder just a coder…** Because for the longest time, over years of televised incoherent political debates, they preyed on our sense of citizenship and civic duty. They monopolized all matters related to the functioning of the state so we may never know where to begin to challenge their authority.

What’s sadder, is that the words they use to scare us are the very words they have abused and drained of meaning: Constitution, Parliament, Electoral law, Chamber of deputies, Cabinet…

And we let them. For over 30 years, our joie de vivre and humility combined with a culture of “leave it to the experts”, (“**خلي الخبز للخباز**”) drove us to delegate our rights, our daily bread, our environment and the education of our children, to _Ali Baba and the 40 thieves_.

One way or another, between family and entertainment, responsibility and survival, we always had better things to do or bigger fish to fry. And that’s precisely what our corrupt leaders counted on. Our distraction. They counted on our mothers to fear for us and keep us off the streets just as they counted on our ambitions to push us abroad and on our diaspora to keep banks afloat.

_It seems they miscalculated._

**_Our diaspora has withdrawn hard-earned savings. Our mothers’ eyes have hardened with determination. Disappointment after disappointment, we imagined the outline of a window on the walls of our cells, and we used it to get out and meet our neighbors._** We just spent nearly two weeks on the streets reminding them we exist, realizing their worst nightmares, united despite their worst efforts.

Without ever relieving the pressure of protest, the time has come for us to use some our newfound fearlessness, to seek the knowledge we lack. Learn with fliers, learn from others, scroll, click, ask, question, discuss and read, read, read. Because soon, we will have to make choices and they better be educated ones.

For that, we must remember and remind each other that:

* Any information we lack is a finite body of knowledge with a clear beginning and a clear end. **_It is not beyond any of us and we can grasp most of it in short hours._**
* **_Before we can reform any of it, we must first know and understand it._**
* **_Knowing this information is the civic duty of each and every one of us_**, not something we can leave to others, be they journalists, lawyers or political analysts.
* **_This is no time for feeling ashamed or shaming each other._** Those of us who don’t know should ask without fear, and those of us who do know should share without judgment.

**Most importantly, let us not bicker over language barriers and who’s more Lebanese than who. Our country has a difficult history of occupation, mandates and immigration. If some of us are not fluent in Arabic, they are no less citizens and no less the children of the circumstances that divided us.**

_With open arms that include everyone_, without fear of asking, masking mistakes or sounding stupid, let’s share and explain the constitution and its amendments. Whether we want it preserved, changed or scrapped. First we must learn. Share every agreement and term standing between us and a way forward. Simplify and share in any language, in any medium, in any form. Share in Arabic, English, French, Portuguese, Spanish. Share using words, illustration, animation, sign language. Look up sources, question agendas. **Check, double check and triple check everything… and all this, while waving the flag.**

### From this point onward, We The People, are the proofreaders of our own destinies.
